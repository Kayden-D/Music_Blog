  <div class="second">
    <div class="second-a">Live music is the oldest form of music in human history, being the starting point of music there have been many ways that live music has been spread. Folk lore and sea shanties were spread by word of mouth making them different every time they were heard and much more local where they were known, while later music began having a universal written form making it much easier to spread and share.</div>
    <div class="second-b">Long playing vinyl records were first invented in 1948 by Peter Carl Goldmark allowing for the style of vinyl records that we are accustomed to nowadays. Being one of the most revied musical mediums many people know about vinyl records and the record players they use, which is often seen as a trendy or cool item to own with the new modern versions of record players that merge the older style with modern tech. </div>
	<div class="second-c">Cassettes were invented in 1962, and with them came the invention of the Walkman. With a cassette and a Walkman anybody could listen to music while on the go. While there had been portable radios before there was no way to pick what music you were after while out and about before. Cassettes also introduced the idea of recording your own music or songs you wanted, which is where we get the word mixtape. </div>
	<div class="second-d">CDs, also known as compact discs, were invented in 1979 and became available to the public in 1982. CDs became the most compact and efficient way to store and listen to music, the Walkman for cassettes was recreated to use CDs allowing for near instantaneous rewind and skipping compared to cassettes. CDs are still a common form of music to this day often time having a CD player in a laptop or car.</div>
	<div class="second-e">Mp3 players were invented in 1979 but were not well designed or popular until Apple released their version in 2001, greatly improving the design and ease of use for consumers. With the entrance into the digital age of listening to music came new features: paywalls for digital music, the shuffle feature, and stronger concerns for piracy; With the new slim size and clean design mp3 players were extremely compact compared to any previous music medium.</div>
	<div class="second-f">Streaming is now the most popular and commonly used medium of music, but it ironically has its roots in piracy as the first music 'streaming' was a website service in 1999 called Beam-It that allowed users to rip music off a CD and upload it to a digital library they could then stream it from. Now the most common music streaming services consist of Spotify, Apple Music, and YouTube Music.</div>
